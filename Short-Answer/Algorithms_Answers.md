#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n**3) because n is being multiplied by itself 3 times


b)O(n**2) this has a loop with with in a loop


c) O(n) this one was easy you just run it n times

## Exercise II
Ok so i would cut the building in half //2  and drop an egg. Now if it breaks i can git rid of all the floors on the top half. But if it doesnt break then i would have do the same to the bottom half. From here you would just have to keep doing this until you figure out what is the lowest floor that the egg breaks.


Now the runtime complexity would have to be O log(n) becasue the steps are decreased as the floors are increased
